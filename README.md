# Data types registration example

This repo provides the resulting code for my article: Data types registration in Rust. There are several executable files for major step in that article:

1. [main.rs](https://github.com/LDiazN/example-registration/blob/main/example-registration/src/main.rs): Final code
2. [example_component_registration.rs](https://github.com/LDiazN/example-registration/blob/main/example-registration/src/bin/example_component_registration.rs): First component registration demo
3. [example_naive_system_registration.rs](https://github.com/LDiazN/example-registration/blob/main/example-registration/src/bin/example_naive_system_registration.rs): Component and system registration with execution order issues
4. [example_ctor.rs](https://github.com/LDiazN/example-registration/blob/main/example-registration/src/bin/example_ctor.rs): Example usage of ctor
